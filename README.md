# Air Conditioner Controller for Toshiba Units

Well, it just fetches the status at the moment and prints it.. but eventually!

Thanks to https://github.com/KaSroka/Toshiba-AC-control for giving me a base to
work from.

Currently prints out something like:

```
Living room
        Power: Off
        Mode: Auto
        Current Temp: 21
        Target Temp: 24
Office
        Power: On
        Mode: Auto
        Current Temp: 24
        Target Temp: 24
Kitchen
        Power: Off
        Mode: Dry
        Current Temp: 23
        Target Temp: 24
Bedroom
        Power: Off
        Mode: Auto
        Current Temp: 22

```
